The Driver Drowsiness Dataset (DDD) is an extracted and cropped faces of drivers from the videos of the Real-Life Drowsiness Dataset. The frames were extracted from videos as images using VLC software. After that, the Viola-Jones algorithm has been used to extract the region of interest from captured images. The obtained dataset (DDD) has been used for training and testing CNN architecture for driver drowsiness detection in the “Detection and Prediction of Driver Drowsiness for the Prevention of Road Accidents Using Deep Neural Networks Techniques” paper.
